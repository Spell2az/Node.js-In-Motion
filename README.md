# Node.js-In-Action
Supporting files for the Node.js In Action livevideo course from Manning

## Important
To save space, dependancies are not included. Before running each project, from the code's root directory, run npm install to download required modules. For example:

`$ cd "Unit 4 - Databases/U4-M1-trysqlite"`

`$ npm install`


## Update: Security Vulnerability Warnings

When installing modules using *npm install*, you may receive warnings about security vulnerabilities. These warnings will not stop your code working but do highlight issues
that have emerged since the publication of this course. None of the code provided here is intended to be used in a production environment in any way. These vunerabilities
only come in to play if others have access to the running server and/or code.
